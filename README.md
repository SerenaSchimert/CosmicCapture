# About the Project
Cosmic Capture was completed as the term project for the games programming course at University of Calgary, CPSC 585, in a team of four; to see the other contributors, trace back the fork or click on this link: https://github.com/cpsc585team2/CosmicCapture?organization=cpsc585team2&organization=cpsc585team2

The game is built using C++, OpenGL for graphics, and NVIDIA PHYSX for driving simulation. We also use a few other C/C++ libraries, including SDL2 for input and window management, OpenAL for audio, assimp for loading 3D files, and glm for math.

## Cosmic Capture Demo
Me badly playing Cosmic Capture by myself against the 3 AI. Setup such that with controllers 4 people can play offline on the same computer instead of vs AI, no online playability (outside project scope). The below image is linked to a youtube video:

# How to play

**Requirements:  The game runs on windows computers, and runs best if the computer has a dedicated graphics card. Note that the Microsoft Visual C++ for visual studio 2015, 2017, and 2019 is required in order to run the game, and can be obtained from here: Visual C++ Download.

## Controls: 

We have implemented both keyboard controls (WASD) as well as controller controls (AB, Left joystick), you can accelerate forward, turn left and right, as well as brake and reverse. 

After you pick up a power-up press (SPACEBAR) on keyboard, (X) on controller to use power-up.
If you get stuck or get sent flying you can respawn your car, to respawn press (R) on keyboard, (Y) on controller.

When the game loads you will be greeted with a title screen, press (ENTER) on keyboard, press (BACK) on controller to get to the character select screen.
Press (SPACE) on keyboard or (X) on controller to determine which position you would like and once all the players are in, each player must confirm they are ready by pressing either (SPACE) or (X) again. Once all players have confirmed they are ready the game will start.

When the game ends, press (ENTER) on keyboard, (BACK) on controller to restart the game.
